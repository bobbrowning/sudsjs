/** Schema Types
 *
 * The Schema type is split into three parts
 * # TableData: Basic information about the file/table/collection.
 *              Called tabledata because this all started with SQL.
 *
 * # Properties: Information about each field in the file
 *
 * # Children: Information about files that link to this file as children.
 *
 * For a sinple example of a schema using this see:
